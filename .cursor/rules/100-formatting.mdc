# Tool Entry Formatting

## Formatting Rules
- Format each tool entry as an unordered list item (`-`) with:
  - Tool name in bold (`**Tool Name**`).
  - A short description (1-2 sentences, max 280 characters).
  - A link to the toolâ€™s official website or repository in square brackets (`[Link](https://example.com)`).
- Example:
  ```markdown
  - **TensorFlow** - Open-source ML framework for building and deploying models. [Link](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
