# Awesome AI and Programming Tools Structure

## Purpose
This repository is a curated Awesome List of AI and programming tools, following the conventions of Awesome Lists (e.g., https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). It provides a well-organized, community-driven collection of tools with clear descriptions and links.

## README Structure
- **Header**: Start `README.md` with `# Awesome AI and Programming Tools` and a brief introduction (2-3 sentences) describing the purpose.
- **Table of Contents**: Include a Markdown TOC with links to each category section (e.g., `[Machine Learning](#machine-learning)`).
- **Categories**: Organize tools into logical categories (e.g., Machine Learning, IDEs, Data Visualization) using `##` headings.
- **Contributing Section**: Include a `## Contributing` section linking to `[Contributing](contributing.md)` or summarizing contribution guidelines.
- **License Section**: Include a `## License` section specifying the MIT License.

## Best Practices
- Ensure all tools are high-quality and relevant to AI or programming.
- Check for duplicate tools before adding new entries.
- Update the Table of Contents when adding new categories.
- Use relative paths for internal links (e.g., `[Contributing](contributing.md)`).
- Keep the tone neutral and professional, avoiding promotional language.

## Tool Analysis and Categorization
- When the prompt includes a list of links to tools, automatically analyze each link:
  - Browse or summarize the tool's official page to determine its primary functionality and key features.
  - Generate a short, concise description (1-2 sentences, max 280 characters) based on the analysis.
  - Assign the tool to a logical category (e.g., "Web Scraping and Data Extraction" for scraping tools, "AI Development Frameworks" for SDKs, "IDEs / Development Environments" for editors). If the category doesn't fit existing ones, create a new relevant category or use "Miscellaneous AI Tools".
  - Ensure the description is neutral, factual, and highlights the tool's main purpose.
- After analysis, add the tool to the appropriate category in `README.md` using the formatting from `@100-formatting` and `@tool-entry-template`.
- If analysis requires external information, use available tools or assume based on URL if direct access isn't possible.
- Avoid duplicates by checking existing entries before adding.
